      "Answer: Protection measures for everyoneStay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions:Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.Keep up to date on thelatest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 isspreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places  – especially if you are an older personor have diabetes, heart or lung disease.Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas. Protection measures for persons who are in or have recently visited (past 14 days) areas where COVID-19 is spreadingFollow the guidanceoutlined above (Protectionmeasures for everyone) Self-isolate by staying at home if you begin to feel unwell, even with mild symptoms such as headache, low grade fever (37.3 C or above) and slight runny nose, until you recover. If it is essential for you to have someone bring you supplies or to go out, e.g. to buy food, then wear a mask to avoid infecting other people.Why? Avoiding contact with others and visits to medical facilities will allow these facilities to operate more effectively and help protect you and others from possible COVID-19 and other viruses.If you develop fever, coughand difficulty breathing, seek medical advice promptly as this may be dueto a respiratory infection or other serious condition. Call in advance andtell your provider of any recenttravel or contact with travelers.Why? Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will also help to prevent possible spread of COVID-19 and other viruses.\n",

Parts of the fibrous membrane may thicken to form ligaments, which further stabilize the joint. Ligaments outside the capsule usually provide additional reinforcement. Another common but not universal feature of synovial joints is the presence of additional structures within the area enclosed by the capsule or synovial membrane, such as articular discs (usually composed of fibrocartilage), fat pads, and tendons. Articular discs absorb compression forces, adjust to changes in the contours of joint surfaces during movements, and increase the range of movements that can occur at joints. Fat pads usually occur between the synovial membrane and the capsule and move into and out of regions as joint contours change during movement. Redundant regions of the synovial membrane and fibrous membrane allow for large movements at joints. Descriptions of synovial joints based on shape and movement\n",

It is firmly anchored to the medial process of the calcaneal tuberosity and extends forward as a thick band of longitudinally arranged connective tissue fibers. The fibers diverge as they pass anteriorly and form digital bands, which enter the toes and connect with bones, ligaments, and dermis of the skin. Distal to the metatarsophalangeal joints, the digital bands of the plantar aponeurosis are interconnected by transverse fibers, which form superficial transverse metatarsal ligaments.

A jelly-like matrix is formed, and further migration of collagen-producing cells occurs. On this soft tissue framework, calcium hydroxyapatite is produced by osteoblasts and forms insoluble crystals, and then bone matrix is laid down. As more bone is produced, a callus can be demonstrated forming across the fracture site. Treatment of fractures requires a fracture line reduction. If this cannot be maintained in a plaster of Paris cast, it may require internal or external fixation with screws and metal rods (Fig. 1.16B). In the clinic\n",

      "Answer: Osteoporotic wedge fractures (Fig. 2.25) typically occur in the thoracolumbar region, and the approach to performing vertebroplasty is novel and relatively straightforward. The procedure is performed under sedation or light general anesthetic. Using X-ray guidance the pedicle is identified on the anteroposterior image. A metal cannula is placed through the pedicle into the vertebral body. Liquid bone cement is injected via the cannula into the vertebral body (Fig. 2.26). The function of the bone cement is two-fold. First, it increases the strength of the vertebral body and prevents further loss of height. Furthermore, as the bone cement sets, there is a degree of heat generated that is believed to disrupt pain nerve endings. Kyphoplasty is a similar technique that aims to restore some or all of the lost vertebral body height from the wedge fracture by injecting liquid bone cement into the vertebral body.

      "Answer: After a fracture has occurred, the natural response is to heal the fracture. Between the fracture margins a blood clot is formed into which new vessels grow. A jelly-like matrix is formed, and further migration of collagen-producing cells occurs. On this soft tissue framework, calcium hydroxyapatite is produced by osteoblasts and forms insoluble crystals, and then bone matrix is laid down. As more bone is produced, a callus can be demonstrated forming across the fracture site. Treatment of fractures requires a fracture line reduction. If this cannot be maintained in a plaster of Paris cast, it may require internal or external fixation with screws and metal rods (Fig. 1.16B). In the clinic\n",

      "Answer: The fibrous membrane is formed by dense connective tissue and surrounds and stabilizes the joint. Parts of the fibrous membrane may thicken to form ligaments, which further stabilize the joint. Ligaments outside the capsule usually provide additional reinforcement. Another common but not universal feature of synovial joints is the presence of additional structures within the area enclosed by the capsule or synovial membrane, such as articular discs (usually composed of fibrocartilage), fat pads, and tendons. Articular discs absorb compression forces, adjust to changes in the contours of joint surfaces during movements, and increase the range of movements that can occur at joints. Fat pads usually occur between the synovial membrane and the capsule and move into and out of regions as joint contours change during movement. Redundant regions of the synovial membrane and fibrous membrane allow for large movements at joints. Descriptions of synovial joints based on shape and movement\n"
